Phoenix-Airline is a multifunctional web application that customers can use to book a flight and search & find flights without booking a ticket. 

Following are the steps of work flow:

1. Airline Admin will add & can approve the airline management staff.
2. There are two types of staff categories:

   Staff members need to register on the system using the staff registration form, and Staff can log in using a registered    email password after the admin approves and selects the staff grade. 
      * Grade one Staff (G1)
          - G1 Staff can view, update and delete user information & flight section, and booking section 
      * Grade two Staff (G2)
          - G2 Staff can view information and only add new flight details
3. Public users can't enter the system without registration on the system, so the user needs to register and log in using the registered user name and email. 
4. After login into the system public user can book a ticket for a flight, and without booking user can search or find flight details like arrival and departure date/time and user can view the reserved ticket list in the profile section and also can update profile details & contact the airline management to clarify anything about Phoenix-Airline
